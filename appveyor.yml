# Appveyor configuration template for Rust using rustup for Rust installation
# https://github.com/starkat99/appveyor-rust
# Based on the "trust" template v0.1.2
# https://github.com/japaric/trust/tree/v0.1.2

## Operating System (VM environment) ##

# Rust needs at least Visual Studio 2013 Appveyor OS for MSVC targets.
os: Visual Studio 2015

## Build Matrix ##

# This configuration will setup a build for each channel & target combination (12 windows
# combinations in all).
#
# There are 3 channels: stable, beta, and nightly.
#
# Alternatively, the full version may be specified for the channel to build using that specific
# version (e.g. channel: 1.5.0)
#
# The values for target are the set of windows Rust build targets. Each value is of the form
#
# ARCH-pc-windows-TOOLCHAIN
#
# Where ARCH is the target architecture, either x86_64 or i686, and TOOLCHAIN is the linker
# toolchain to use, either msvc or gnu. See https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot for
# a description of the toolchain differences.
# See https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/#toolchain-specification for description of
# toolchains and host triples.
#
# Comment out channel/target combos you do not wish to build in CI.
#
# You may use the `cargoflags` and `RUSTFLAGS` variables to set additional flags for cargo commands
# and rustc, respectively. For instance, you can uncomment the cargoflags lines in the nightly
# channels to enable unstable features when building for nightly. Or you could add additional
# matrix entries to test different combinations of features.
environment:
  global:
  # TODO This is the Rust channel that build jobs will use by default but can be
  # overridden on a case by case basis down below
    RUST_VERSION: stable

    # TODO Update this to match the name of your project.
    CRATE_NAME: kill_gta5_when_closed_rs
  matrix:
    # MinGW
    - TARGET: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

    # MSVC
    - TARGET: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

    # # Testing other channels
    # - TARGET: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
    #   RUST_VERSION: nightly
    # - TARGET: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    #   RUST_VERSION: nightly

### Allowed failures ###

# # See Appveyor documentation for specific details. In short, place any channel or targets you wish
# # to allow build failures on (usually nightly at least is a wise choice). This will prevent a build
# # or test failure in the matching channels/targets from failing the entire build.
# matrix:
#   allow_failures:
#     - channel: nightly

# If you only care about stable channel build failures, uncomment the following line:
    #- channel: beta

## Install Script ##

# This is the most important part of the Appveyor configuration. This installs the version of Rust
# specified by the 'channel' and 'target' environment variables from the build matrix. This uses
# rustup to install Rust.
#
# For simple configurations, instead of using the build matrix, you can simply set the
# default-toolchain and default-host manually here.
