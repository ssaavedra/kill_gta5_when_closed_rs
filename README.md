Kill GTA 5 When Already Closed
==============================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0ffhk8vrrmumce77?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ssaavedra/kill-gta5-when-closed-rs)

This is a toy project which has a single useful purpose: kill GTA 5 after exiting an online game.

It seems to be a bug from Rockstar, and I wanted to learn some Rust on the way.

Binaries are pushed through AppVeyor so that you don't need to trust my exe's.

You can build this with:

```
cargo build --release
```

Contributions
=============

Any contributions are welcome, but a lot of maintenance here is not expected.
